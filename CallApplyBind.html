 <!--
   call, apply, and bind are methods that allow  to manipulate the context (the value of this) of a function. 
   They are often used in situations where we want to explicitly set the value of this when calling a function.
   call and apply: 
     are used to invoke a function immediately, with call taking individual arguments, and apply taking an array-like object of arguments.
   bind: 
     is used to create a new function with a specified this value and optionally pre-set arguments, but it does not invoke the function immediately.
   Instead, it returns a new function that can be called later.

  //Call example 1:
   //The call() method is a predefined JavaScript method.
   //It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
   //With call(), an object can use a method belonging to another object.

   //This example calls the fullName method of person, using it on person1:

   /*const person = {
     fullName: function() {
       console.log( this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
     }
   }
   const person1 = {
     firstName:"John",
     lastName: "Doe"
   }
   const person2 = {
     firstName:"Mary",
     lastName: "Doe"
   }


person.fullName.call(person1);
person.fullname.call(person2);*/

//with argument

/*const person = {
  fullName: function(city, country) {
    document.write (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country);
  }
}

const person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}

person.fullName.call(person1, "Oslo", "Norway");*/

// The Difference Between call() and apply()
// The difference is:

// The call() method takes arguments separately.

// The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
/*
const person = {
  fullName: function(city, country) {
    document.write (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country);
  }
}

const person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}

person.fullName.apply(person1, ["Oslo", "Norway"]);
*/

//bind method

// With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

// The example below creates 2 objects (person and member).

// The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:


const person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function () {
    console.log (this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
  }
}

const member = {
  firstName:"Hege",
  lastName: "Nilsen",
}

let fullName = person.fullName.bind(member);
fullName();
// Creates a new function with a fixed this value but does not immediately invoke the function. The new function can be invoked later.
// It is useful when you want to create a function with a specific context that you can use later without worrying about the this value changing.
